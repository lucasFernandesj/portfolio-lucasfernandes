        <span class="big">About</span><br />
        I'm Lucas, I am passionate about building new<br> tools
        that can be useful to others and I found in coding
        a great way to fulfill it.<br />
        I like to undestand deeply how systems work and have 
        a profound curiosity about new technologies and how 
        they can be used to improve our lives.<br />
        On my free time I like to watch material about coding(of course),
        as well as learning new practices that can be added to my projects<br>
        Outside of the realm of coding , I like to learn about languages
         and cultures , right now I am studying Russian.<br>
         Health is another topic that broadly interests me,
          every day I try to move my body in a challenging
           and engaging way and I like to observe proper nutrition.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="a1 visible">In 5 years I see myself as an experienced developer, 
           being more engaged on our company's projects, possibly
           leading a team and mentoring newcoming juniors.<br>
           On my path I want to learn new languages and technologies and to apply them on our projects.

          <span class="a2 visible">Everyday I wake up and search for new ways to implement the 
            technologies I know and what new technologies are out there for me to discover,
             that's part of a successfull morning routine for me to keep up with what's new 
             in a fun and engaging way.<br> I like to watch videos about the latest trends and
              tutorials as well as read on forums.</span>
